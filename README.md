# Fisticuffs

Simple Unity3D game scripted and assembled by me at Weather Gage Workshop. It is far from complete, but it was a fun and instructive project to work on. I got to work with an excellent team of creative people and develop my engineering abilities. There are a number of things that I would change if I were to start it over again: it uses .Find() methods at run time pretty constantly, which is terrible practice, for instance.

There are two things I'd like to try next. The first is to swing back around to JavaScript and try scripting a Unity3D game with that. The other is to try Unreal, which is now free! That would mean going back to C++, but after so long away, that might not be a bad idea.
